### What you used to develop and test?

- I used Adobe XD to extract the needed design assets.
- Used VSCode for code editing and google chrome for testing and debugging.
- Took about 19h to build (Thursday to Thursday)
- Replaced Grunt with Create React App and added the dependencies:
	- Bootstrap - css only, used it for building the grid and utility classes
	- Classnames -to facilitate the usage of class names
	- Sass - to help writing less styling code with its hierarchy approach and functionalities
	- React Router - I added it just to make page navigation work

### Decisions?

- From Exercise 1:
	- I built the header and footer for desktop and mobile.
- From Exercise 2:
	- Did all the tasks except for unit testing

### What did you like?
